# The jQuery Squares Challenge

jQuery is one of the most used javascript libraries on earth, and is useful for adding dynamism interaction to your webpage without having to write vanilla javascript. In the following challenge, you'll get the chance to put your jQuery ninja skills to use by manipulating the DOM!

Good luck!

## Instructions

Fork and clone this lab, and then open up `index.html` to see the current state of the site and the instructions for each part of the challenge. In `script.js`, write your jQuery code to get the squares to change based on the instructions!

You may not modify the index.html page, but can add to `style.css` and `script.js`
